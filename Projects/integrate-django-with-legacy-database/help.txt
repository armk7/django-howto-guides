Django is able to integrate itself with existing legacy databases.

(for this howto, i will use the previous howto's sqlite database)
(it had a product table that belonged to the shop app)
(if you're using another existing database, you need to update the DATABASES config variable in settings.py accordingly)

django has a utility called 'inspectdb' that introspects an existing db...
and tries to generate the model classes for you automatically.

> python manage.py inspectdb
(running this file will output db models in terminal)
(it's more useful to output the result into a .py file with a name of your choosing)

> python manage.py inspectdb > <inspected_modesl.py>

(i already had added the shop app and added it to INSTALLED_APPS)

this feature is not foolproof, it's simply a utility shortcut.
you may have to edit the models yourself.

then makemigrations and migrate. the model should be in database.

if you take a look at the produced file, you'll see that all files have managed = False in their Meta.
this tells django not to manage the table's creation, modification or deletion.
the default is True.
if you keep it False, django will create a migration for it, but it will not be included in database after calling migrate command.
